Sample SQL Databases
Welcome to my Github repository! This repository showcases a collection of SQL databases that I have built. I have designed these databases using SQL
Server Management Studio and other database design tools. Each file contains the database architecture I used to construct the database, along with sample
functions and procedures to improve usability and protect data quality. I have also include a small list of sample queries for each database to answer
hypothetical business questions to showcase the value of each database. Please feel free to explore them and contact me if you have any questions or 
comments.
